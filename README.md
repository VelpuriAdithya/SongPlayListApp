# Title: SongPlayList Application

# Overview:
The Music Player Application is a console-based Java application that simulates a music player with a playlist feature. The application allows users to create and manage playlists, add songs to the playlist, and play the songs in the playlist.

# Features:

Album Management: The application allows users to create and manage albums, each with a unique name and artist.

Song Management: Users can add songs to an album, with each song having a title and duration.

Playlist Management: Users can create a playlist and add songs from different albums to the playlist.

Playback Feature: The application allows users to play the songs in the playlist, with options to play the next song, previous song, replay the current song, and delete the current song from the playlist.

User Interface: The application provides a console-based user interface to interact with the music player, with options to quit, play the next song, play the previous song, replay the current song, list all songs in the playlist, and print the menu.

# Technical Details:

The project consists of three Java classes: Main, Album, and Song.
The Main class is the entry point of the application and provides the user interface.
The Album class represents an album and has methods to add songs to the album and add songs to a playlist.
The Song class represents a song and has attributes for title and duration.
The application uses an ArrayList to store albums and a LinkedList to store the playlist.
The application uses a ListIterator to iterate over the playlist and provide playback functionality.
